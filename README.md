# ML Data Cleaning & Visualization

This repository contains resources and code for data preprocessing and data visualization to support machine learning and data science workflows.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques to clean and prepare raw datasets for analysis and modeling.
- **Data Visualization**: Explore and communicate data insights through graphical representations.
- Example files and Jupyter notebooks demonstrate best practices using real datasets.

## Contents

- `cleaned_dataset.csv` — Preprocessed sample dataset ready for further analysis.
- `soil_pollution_diseases.csv` — Example of a raw dataset before cleaning.
- `first_pro.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing code for data cleaning and visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanjaynep/-ml-datacleaning.git
   cd -ml-datacleaning
   ```

2. Open the notebook:

   - You can use Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VSCode to open and run `first_pro.ipynb`.

3. Install necessary dependencies:

   - Recommended libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
   - Install using pip:

     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
     ```

## Usage

- Inspect the notebooks for step-by-step demonstrations of:
  - Handling missing values
  - Data normalization and transformation
  - Generating summary statistics
  - Creating visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.)

- Use the provided datasets to experiment with various preprocessing and visualization techniques.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new features, improved cleaning techniques, or additional visualization examples, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
